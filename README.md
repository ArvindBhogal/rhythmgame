# Rhythm Game

First release for the rhythm game that I've been working on for a bit.

Developed in Unity 2D, currently features 10 songs that I made. Main keys to press from left to right are D, F, K, and L, which can be seen when paused during a song.

### Author's Notes (2022-09-15) ###

Took me a while, but I was able to make an app and actually 'release' it. Of course, there's still a lot of stuff to change up, but this is a good place for me to start off. There's still quite a lot of things I want to do for this, but for now here's the initial version to show the concept. For now, if you do download the game, I hope you enjoy what little there is to it.
